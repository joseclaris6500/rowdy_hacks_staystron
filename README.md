Inspiration
The inspiration behind the project was having a close friend that was recently diagnosed with the HIV viruses. And from attending a university where it's in the countryside of Texas, it can be difficult for my friend to talk to other friends that are quick to shut down anyone who carries any deadly disease. Every time I saw my friend, I would see my friend being alone and not having no one to really confine to about talking about being recently diagnosed with the disease. I want to create a mobile app where my friend could connect with others who are HIV/AIDS carries and have the opportunity to share experiences of the day my friend was diagnosed and to read from other on how they cope with the disease.

What it does
It's able to connect individuals who have been diagnosed with the HIV/AIDS disease and give them an anonymous space for them to share their experiences of living with the disease and how they go day to day with it. It would also allow users to be able to have one-on-one messaging with another user that is trustworthy.

How we built it
We tried to build our app with the Android Studio platform, Google Maps Places API and utilized Google Cloud Firebase to have user authentication.

What's next for Stay Strong
What's next is to dedicate more time to continue developing and adding more well-thought out features to the app. Also to covert it into the iOS platform.

Technologies Used:
Java
Android Studio
